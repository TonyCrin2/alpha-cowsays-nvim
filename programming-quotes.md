# Programming Quotes

The quotes on this page come from this deleted question on Stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58640/great-programming-quotes

## The Question

There are a lot of great programming quotes out there. Which do you like?

Today (Sept 12, 2008) I heard a new one from a friend, Lars-Gunnar, he said " [Gud](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gud) \[1\] finns i Emacs" (in Swedish). This basically means " [God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) \[2\] is in Emacs". Still laughing about it here :) What he meant was that a function " [gud is grand-unified-debugger](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/GrandUnifiedDebugger) \[3\]" is in Emacs.

A great one I think all programmers should know is [The Three Great Virtues of a Programmer](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris) \[4\].

The 3 virtues of a programmer as defined by Larry Wall, Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Christiansen (in Programming Perl).

1.  **Laziness** - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris.

2.  **Impatience** - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris.

3.  **Hubris** - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience.

"There's no test like production"

> We better hurry up and start coding, there are going to be a lot of bugs to fix.

- - -

Charles M Strauss:

> Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.

> The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not-working to working.

\-- _John Ousterhout_

From Bill Bryson

> A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match

- - -

Dennis Ritchie

> UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.

- - -

> Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say "hey, that almost works for me", and they'll get involved in the project.

A good programmer looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.

- - -

**C** You shoot yourself in the foot.

**C++** You accidently create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just pointing at others and saying "That's me, over there."

**FORTRAN** You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you run out of bullets, you continue anyway because you have no exception-handling facility.

**Modula-2** After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything in this language, you shoot yourself in the head.

**COBOL** USEing a COLT 45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at LEG.FOOT, THEN place ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER and SQUEEZE. THEN return HANDGUN to HOLSTER. CHECK whether shoelace needs to be retied.

**Lisp** You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds...

**BASIC** Shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol. On big systems, continue until entire lower body is waterlogged.

**Forth** Foot yourself in the shoot.

**APL** You shoot yourself in the foot; then spend all day figuring out how to do it in fewer characters.

**Pascal** The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.

**Snobol** If you succeed, shoot yourself in the left foot. If you fail, shoot yourself in the right foot.

**HyperTalk** Put the first bullet of the gun into foot left of leg of you. Answer the result.

**Prolog** You tell your program you want to be shot in the foot. The program figures out how to do it, but the syntax doesn't allow it to explain.

**370 JCL** You send your foot down to MIS with a 4000-page document explaining how you want it to be shot. Three years later, your foot comes back deep-fried.

**FORTRAN-77** You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you run out of bullets, you continue anyway because you still can't do exception-processing.

**Modula-2 (alternative)** You perform a shooting on what might be currently a foot with what might be currently a bullet shot by what might currently be a gun.

**BASIC (compiled)** You shoot yourself in the foot with a BB using a SCUD missile launcher.

**Visual Basic** You'll really only appear to have shot yourself in the foot, but you'll have so much fun doing it that you won't care.

**Forth (alternative)** BULLET DUP3 \* GUN LOAD FOOT AIM TRIGGER PULL BANG! EMIT DEAD IF DROP ROT THEN (This takes about five bytes of memory, executes in two to ten clock cycles on any processor and can be used to replace any existing function of the language as well as in any future words). (Welcome to bottom up programming - where you, too, can perform compiler pre-processing instead of writing code)

**APL (alternative)** You hear a gunshot and there's a hole in your foot, but you don't remember enough linear algebra to understand what happened. or @#&^$%&%^ foot

**Pascal (alternative)** Same as Modula-2 except that the bullet is not the right type for the gun and your hand is blown off.

**Snobol (alternative)** You grab your foot with your hand, then rewrite your hand to be a bullet. The act of shooting the original foot then changes your hand/bullet into yet another foot (a left foot).

**Prolog (alternative)** You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot, but the bullet, failing to find its mark, backtracks to the gun, which then explodes in your face. or No.

**COMAL** You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol, but the bore is clogged, and the pressure build-up blows apart both the pistol and your hand. or draw\_pistol aim\_at\_foot(left) pull\_trigger hop(swearing)

**Scheme** As Lisp, but none of the other appendages are aware of this happening.

**Algol** You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket is aesthetically fascinating and the wound baffles the adolescent medic in the emergency room.

**Ada** If you are dumb enough to actually use this language, the United States Department of Defense will kidnap you, stand you up in front of a firing squad and tell the soldiers, "Shoot at the feet."
or
The Department of Defense shoots you in the foot after offering you a blindfold and a last cigarette.
or
After correctly packaging your foot, you attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream and shoot yourself in the foot. When you try, however, you discover that your foot is of the wrong type.
or
After correctly packing your foot, you attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream, and confidently aim at your foot knowing it is safe. However the cordite in the round does an Unchecked Conversion, fires and shoots you in the foot anyway.

**Eiffel** You create a GUN object, two FOOT objects and a BULLET object. The GUN passes both the FOOT objects a reference to the BULLET. The FOOT objects increment their hole counts and forget about the BULLET. A little demon then drives a garbage truck over your feet and grabs the bullet (both of it) on the way.

**Smalltalk** You spend so much time playing with the graphics and windowing system that your boss shoots you in the foot, takes away your workstation and makes you develop in COBOL on a character terminal.
or
You send the message shoot to gun, with selectors bullet and myFoot. A window pops up saying Gunpowder doesNotUnderstand: spark. After several fruitless hours spent browsing the methods for Trigger, FiringPin and IdealGas, you take the easy way out and create ShotFoot, a subclass of Foot with an additional instance variable bulletHole.

**Object Oriented Pascal** You perform a shooting on what might currently be a foot with what might currently be a bullet fired from what might currently be a gun.

**PL/I** You consume all available system resources, including all the offline bullets. The Data Processing & Payroll Department doubles its size, triples its budget, acquires four new mainframes and drops the original one on your foot.

**Postscript** foot bullets 6 locate loadgun aim gun shoot showpage
or
It takes the bullet ten minutes to travel from the gun to your foot, by which time you're long since gone out to lunch. The text comes out great, though.

**PERL** You stab yourself in the foot repeatedly with an incredibly large and very heavy Swiss Army knife.
or
You pick up the gun and begin to load it. The gun and your foot begin to grow to huge proportions and the world around you slows down, until the gun fires. It makes a tiny hole, which you don't feel.

**Assembly Language** You crash the OS and overwrite the root disk. The system administrator arrives and shoots you in the foot. After a moment of contemplation, the administrator shoots himself in the foot and then hops around the room rabidly shooting at everyone in sight. or You try to shoot yourself in the foot only to discover you must first reinvent the gun, the bullet, and your foot.or The bullet travels to your foot instantly, but it took you three weeks to load the round and aim the gun.

**BCPL** You shoot yourself somewhere in the leg -- you can't get any finer resolution than that.

**Concurrent Euclid** You shoot yourself in somebody else's foot.

**Motif** You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the trajectory, the bullet and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles of the gun. When you finally get around to pulling the trigger, the gun jams.

**Powerbuilder** While attempting to load the gun you discover that the LoadGun system function is buggy; as a work around you tape the bullet to the outside of the gun and unsuccessfully attempt to fire it with a nail. In frustration you club your foot with the butt of the gun and explain to your client that this approximates the functionality of shooting yourself in the foot and that the next version of Powerbuilder will fix it.

**Standard ML** By the time you get your code to typecheck, you're using a shoot to foot yourself in the gun.

**MUMPS** You shoot 583149 AK-47 teflon-tipped, hollow-point, armour-piercing bullets into even-numbered toes on odd-numbered feet of everyone in the building -- with one line of code. Three weeks later you shoot yourself in the head rather than try to modify that line.

**Java** You locate the Gun class, but discover that the Bullet class is abstract, so you extend it and write the missing part of the implementation. Then you implement the ShootAble interface for your foot, and recompile the Foot class. The interface lets the bullet call the doDamage method on the Foot, so the Foot can damage itself in the most effective way. Now you run the program, and call the doShoot method on the instance of the Gun class. First the Gun creates an instance of Bullet, which calls the doFire method on the Gun. The Gun calls the hit(Bullet) method on the Foot, and the instance of Bullet is passed to the Foot. But this causes an IllegalHitByBullet exception to be thrown, and you die.

**Unix** You shoot yourself in the foot or

    % ls
    foot.c foot.h foot.o toe.c toe.o
    % rm * .o
    rm: .o: No such file or directory
    % ls
    %


**370 JCL (alternative)** You shoot yourself in the head just thinking about it.

**DOS JCL** You first find the building you're in in the phone book, then find your office number in the corporate phone book. Then you have to write this down, then describe, in cubits, your exact location, in relation to the door (right hand side thereof). Then you need to write down the location of the gun (loading it is a proprietary utility), then you load it, and the COBOL program, and run them, and, with luck, it may be run tonight.

**sh,csh, etc** You can't remember the syntax for anything, so you spend five hours reading manual pages, then your foot falls asleep. You shoot the computer and switch to C.

**Apple System 7** Double click the gun icon and a window giving a selection for guns, target areas, plus balloon help with medical remedies, and assorted sound effects. Click "shoot" button and a small bomb appears with note "Error of Type 1 has occurred."

**Windows 3.1** Double click the gun icon and wait. Eventually a window opens giving a selection for guns, target areas, plus balloon help with medical remedies, and assorted sound effects. Click "shoot" button and a small box appears with note "Unable to open Shoot.dll, check that path is correct."

**Windows 95** Your gun is not compatible with this OS and you must buy an upgrade and install it before you can continue. Then you will be informed that you don't have enough memory.

**CP/M** I remember when shooting yourself in the foot with a BB gun was a big deal.

**DOS** You finally found the gun, but can't locate the file with the foot for the life of you.

**MSDOS** You shoot yourself in the foot, but can unshoot yourself with add-on software.

**Access** You try to point the gun at your foot, but it shoots holes in all your Borland distribution diskettes instead.

**Paradox** Not only can you shoot yourself in the foot, your users can too.

**dBase** You squeeze the trigger, but the bullet moves so slowly that by the time your foot feels the pain, you've forgotten why you shot yourself anyway. or You buy a gun. Bullets are only available from another company and are promised to work so you buy them. Then you find out that the next version of the gun is the one scheduled to actually shoot bullets.

**DBase IV, V1.0** You pull the trigger, but it turns out that the gun was a poorly designed hand grenade and the whole building blows up.

**SQL** You cut your foot off, send it out to a service bureau and when it returns, it has a hole in it but will no longer fit the attachment at the end of your leg; or

    Insert into Foot
    Select Bullet
    From Gun.Hand
    Where Chamber = 'LOADED'
    And Trigger = 'PULLED'


**Clipper** You grab a bullet, get ready to insert it in the gun so that you can shoot yourself in the foot and discover that the gun that the bullets fits has not yet been built, but should be arriving in the mail \_REAL\_SOON\_NOW\_.

**Oracle** The menus for coding foot\_shooting have not been implemented yet and you can't do foot shooting in SQL.

**English** You put your foot in your mouth, then bite it off. (For those who don't know, English is a McDonnell Douglas/PICK query language which allegedly requires 110% of system resources to run happily.)

**Revelation \[an implementation of the PICK Operating System\]** You'll be able to shoot yourself in the foot just as soon as you figure out what all these bullets are for.

**FlagShip** Starting at the top of your head, you aim the gun at yourself repeatedly until, half an hour later, the gun is finally pointing at your foot and you pull the trigger. A new foot with a hole in it appears but you can't work out how to get rid of the old one and your gun doesn't work anymore.

**FidoNet** You put your foot in your mouth, then echo it internationally.

**PicoSpan \[a UNIX-based computer conferencing system\]** You can't shoot yourself in the foot because you're not a host. or (host variation) Whenever you shoot yourself in the foot, someone opens a topic in policy about it.

**Internet** You put your foot in your mouth, shoot it, then spam the bullet so that everybody gets shot in the foot.

**CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)** You only fail to shoot everything that isn't your foot.

**MS-SQL Server** MS-SQL Server’s gun comes pre-loaded with an unlimited supply of Teflon coated bullets, and it only has two discernible features: the muzzle and the trigger. If that wasn't enough, MS-SQL Server also puts the gun in your hand, applies local anesthetic to the skin of your forefinger and stitches it to the gun's trigger. Meanwhile, another process has set up a spinal block to numb your lower body. It will then proceeded to surgically remove your foot, cryogenically freeze it for preservation, and attach it to the muzzle of the gun so that no matter where you aim, you will shoot your foot. In order to avoid shooting yourself in the foot, you need to unstitch your trigger finger, remove your foot from the muzzle of the gun, and have it surgically reattached. Then you probably want to get some crutches and go out to buy a book on SQL Server Performance Tuning.

**Sybase** Sybase's gun requires assembly, and you need to go out and purchase your own clip and bullets to load the gun. Assembly is complicated by the fact that Sybase has hidden the gun behind a big stack of reference manuals, but it hasn't told you where that stack is. While you were off finding the gun, assembling it, buying bullets, etc., Sybase was also busy surgically removing your foot and cryogenically freezing it for preservation. Instead of attaching it to the muzzle of the gun, though, it packed your foot on dry ice and sent it UPS-Ground to an unnamed hookah bar somewhere in the middle east. In order to shoot your foot, you must modify your gun with a GPS system for targeting and hire some guy named "Indy" to find the hookah bar and wire the coordinates back to you. By this time, you've probably become so daunted at the tasks stand between you and shooting your foot that you hire a guy who's read all the books on Sybase to help you shoot your foot. If you're lucky, he'll be smart enough both to find your foot and to stop you from shooting it.

**Magic software** You spend 1 week looking up the correct syntax for GUN. When you find it, you realise that GUN will not let you shoot in your own foot. It will allow you to shoot almost anything but your foot. You then decide to build your own gun. You can't use the standard barrel since this will only allow for standard bullets, which will not fire if the barrel is pointed at your foot. After four weeks, you have created your own custom gun. It blows up in your hand without warning, because you failed to initialise the safety catch and it doesn't know whether the initial state is "0", 0, NULL, "ZERO", 0.0, 0,0, "0.0", or "0,00". You fix the problem with your remaining hand by nesting 12 safety catches, and then decide to build the gun without safety catch. You then shoot the management and retire to a happy life where you code in languages that will allow you to shoot your foot in under 10 days.

**Ruby** foot.shot(Gun.new)

**CSS** You try to shoot your foot -- and made it on IE 7 but not IE 6.

**Tcl** You first have to decide your object system, but by that time it already has one. You try to use `gun::shoot {foot::create}`, but you realize that you used braces instead of brackets. You spend hours staring at your code until you figure this out.

**StackOverflow** To shoot yourself in the foot, ask a bad question and 5 people will come and shoot your foot.

**ASP .NET** You discover that your client has your foot on his computer but the bullet is in the server database so you use SQL to extract the data for a Bullet object and create a gun class in C#. Then you write some HTML so your client can see the gun. You then discover that there are no controls for actually firing the gun at your foot through your client's browser so you create a mash-up of Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX to try and get the client's computer to shoot your foot. 10 languages, a million hours of testing/debugging, and 4 months later when your customer finally decides to run your web page, you learn that he is running IE6 and your new HTML5 code is not compatible with his old browser so the gun now appears to have two triggers. The client runs the page anyway but the postback gets lost and you never actually know if your foot got shot or not.

If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them, we would need fewer, not more.

I had a mentor who was fond of quoting this (and it's turned out to be good advice):

And they'd say, "I think the best way to do it is B. I'd say, "Well no, it's really A." And they'd say, "Well, we want to do B." It was a turning point for me when I could say, "Fine. Do B. It's not going to hurt us that much if I'm wrong. It's not going to hurt us that much if I'm right and you do B, because, we can correct mistakes. So lets find out if it's a mistake." ...

Debugging code is at least twice as hard as writing it in the first place. Therefore, if you write a program as cleverly as possible you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. (Brian W. Kernighan)

Well over half of the time you spend working on a project (on the order of 70 percent) is spent thinking, and no tool, no matter how advanced, can think for you. Consequently, even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you -- if it wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers -- the best you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in productivity. In order to do better than that, you have to change the way you think.

There is not now, nor has there ever been, nor will there ever be, any programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to write bad code.

Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.

> Abraham Lincoln once said:

But for me, the big problem with "axe sharpening" is that it's recursive. In a [Zeno's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s%5Fparadoxes) \[1\] kind of way: You spend the first two thirds of the time allotted to accomplishing a task actually working on the tool. But working on the tool is itself a task that involves tools: to sharpen the axe, you need a sharpening stone. So you spend two-thirds of the sharpening time coming up with a good sharpening stone. But before you can do that you need to spend time finding the right stone. And before you can do that you need to go to the north coast of Baffin Island where you've heard the best stones for sharpening come from. But to get there, you need to build a dog sled....

See Alan Perlis' _[epigrams in programming](http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html) \[1\]_:

1.  One man's constant is another man's variable.

2.  Functions delay binding; data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the programming process.

3.  Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.

4.  Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.

5.  If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.

6.  Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere.

7.  It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

8.  A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

9.  It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.

10.  ...

**Great Larry Wall Quotes:**

*   _And don't tell me there isn't one bit of difference between null and space, because that's exactly how much difference there is._

*   _It won't be covered in the book. The source code has to be useful for something, after all..._

*   _Just don't create a file called -rf._

*   _Sex is fun, but it probably doesn't solve all your problems._

*   _My assertion that we can do better with computer languages is a persistent belief and fond hope, but you'll note I don't actually claim to be either rational or right. Except when it's convenient._

*   _I try not to confuse roles and traits in my own life. Being the Perl god is a role. Being a stubborn cuss is a trait._

“New technologies aren’t adopted because they are great, new, and disruptive; they are adopted only if the user’s crisis solved by the technology is greater than the perceived pain of adoption.”

Any problem in computer science can be solved with another layer of indirection. But that usually will create another problem. - David Wheeler (1927 - 2004)

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live" - Martin Golding

In my experience, one of the most significant problems in software development is assuming. If you assume a method will passed the right parameter value, the method will fail. – Paul M. Duvall

Programming languages are like girlfriends: The new one is better because _you_ are better. – Derek Sivers

The sooner we start coding fewer frameworks and more programs the sooner we’ll become better programmers. – Warped Java Guy Elementary Java Solutions

Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too, and in some ways a worse kind of hard. – Paul Graham The Future of Web Startups

In essence, let the market design the product. – Paul Graham The Future of Web Startups

A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year old guys. A company like that can move much more easily than one with 10 people, half of whom have kids. – Paul Graham The Future of Web Startups

Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don’t assume when this happens that you’ve failed. That’s normal for startups. But don’t sit around doing nothing. Iterate. – Paul Graham How Not to Die

The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases. – Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy

You’ll spend far more time babysitting old technologies than implementing new ones. – Jason Hiner IT Dirty Secrets

To Iterate is Human, to Recurse, Divine. – James O. Coplien

No one hates software more than software developers. – Jeff Atwood Hanselminutes Podcast 74

I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprised me. – Matz The Philosophy of Ruby

Good architecture is necessary to give programs enough structure to be able to grow large without collapsing into a puddle of confusion. – Douglas Crockford The Elements of JavaScript Style

Programming is difficult. At its core, it is about managing complexity. Computer programs are the most complex things that humans make. Quality is illusive and elusive. – Douglas Crockford The Elements of JavaScript Style

Code reuse is the Holy Grail of Software Engineering. – Douglas Crockford The Elements of JavaScript Style

The structure of software systems tend to reflect the structure of the organization that produce them. – Douglas Crockford The Elements of JavaScript Style

The definition of Hell is working with dates in Java, JDBC, and Oracle. Every single one of them screw it up. – Dick Wall CommunityOne 2007: Lunch with the Java Posse

I went to school to learn how to program software applications, which inevitably have bug defects. There was no course at my university on testing, debugging, profiling, or optimization. These things you have to learn on your own, usually in a tight deadline. – Juixe TechKnow

To most Java developers, Ruby/Rails is like a mistress. Ruby/Rails is young, new, and exciting; but eventually we go back to old faithful, dependable, and employable Java with some new tricks and idioms and we are the better programmer for it. – Juixe TechKnow

Ravera's First Law of System Administration: "Any set of procedures, no matter how well intentioned or useful, that are too difficult to follow, will be circumvented."

You can have it cheap, fast, or right -- pick any two.

If you make it a constant today, you will have to make it a variable in a couple of weeks. If, however, you think that you need to look it up in a table somewhere, it will become a univeral constant that could have been completely factored out of your code, not just hardcoded.

Write in C / [Listen Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5LNTTGDKYo) \[1\]

    When I find my code in tons of trouble,

If P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it’s found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss... — Scott Aaronson, MIT

The main argument in favor of P ≠ NP is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument. The space of algorithms is very large and we are only at the beginning of its exploration. \[. . .\] The resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem also shows that very simply \[sic\] questions may be settled only by very deep theories. —Moshe Y. Vardi, Rice University

Being attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required. —Anil Nerode, Cornell University

> It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience. -Albert Einstein

This has been requoted as "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." but I've never seen where he was actually been documented as saying exactly that.

There are two facets of this quote that relate to software development and maintaining a balance between complexity and simplicity.

The key thing not to miss is "as simple as possible" or "without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum" means that sacrifices should not be made in the name of simplification which would result in over-simplification.

Never make a solution more complex because it feels more clever. Sometimes in the face of a deadline, it could also mean don't make something more complex trying to satisfy non-existent "what if" requirements. The "What if our \[insert software used by 10 internal staff\] goes commercial and we need to provide it in 20 different languages?" Reusability and generalization can be good, but there is a sweet spot of balance between the extra effort becoming wasteful, and the lack of effort creating future challenges.

There are those developers who sometimes don't completely feel out all the scenarios their software will encounter, and then there is the flip side where you have overly passionate developers that sometimes make things far more complex than necessary. Both of which have a lot to gain from this quote.

This one is of unknown origin but I find it funny:

This one really isn't programming related, but programmers certainly know what it means anyway:

A lot of code would be better if programmers kept this creed. Comments are all too often a crutch for bad code. And, of course, if your code is easy to understand sans comments, there is no risk of the comments and the code diverging.

I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation. We still make syntax errors, to be sure; but they are fuzz compared to the conceptual errors in most systems. If this is true, building software will always be hard. There is inherently no silver bullet.
